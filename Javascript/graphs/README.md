# GRAPHS

A graph is any collection of nodes that can be connected.
Singly linked lists and binary trees are graphs.
The actual shape of the graph does not matter, what matters are the connections between nodes
The connection between nodes may or may not have direction

### Graph Terms

Vertex: what we have called a node, a vertex is where connections meet (plural: vertices)
Edge: what we have called a connection, an edge runs between two vertices(nodes)
Walk: a walk is any route from a vertex through edges to subsequent vertices
Circuit: a Circuit is a path (every vertex)that ends where it started; also connected or closed path
Degree: number of edges to/from a vertex, if undirected (in-degree, and out-degree)
