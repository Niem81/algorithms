# Overview: Finding the shortest path from nodes in a graph
# The algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes from a single node ot a single destination
# The shortest path algorithm is used in network routing protocols (like IS-IS and Open Shortest Path First OSPF)
# Also implemented as a subrutine in Johnson's algorithm
